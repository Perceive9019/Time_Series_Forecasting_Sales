# Time Series Analysis: Sales Data

This project conducts a detailed time series analysis of sales data. The primary focus is on understanding the trends and patterns in sales, identifying seasonal variations, and making forecasts. The analysis includes a comprehensive exploration of time series decomposition, stationarity testing, and forecasting using SARIMA and Prophet models.

## Key Sections

1. Introduction to Time Series Analysis: Explains the basics of time series analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning and preparation steps.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of the data to uncover trends and patterns.
4. Time Series Decomposition: This breaks down the time series data into observed, trend, seasonality, and residual components.
5. Testing for Stationarity: Uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests to check the stationarity of the series.
6. Forecasting with SARIMA and Prophet: Application of SARIMA and Prophet models for forecasting future sales.
7.
